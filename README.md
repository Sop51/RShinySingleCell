# Single Cell RNA-seq Shiny App
***
This RShiny application was developed by the Goessling Lab to support members of the zebrafish research community in the analysis and visualization of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. The tool provides an intuitive interface that enables users to:
* Upload and explore their own scRNA-seq datasets
* Generate UMAP visualizations for genes of interest
* Perform differential expression analyses between cell types
* Investigate gene expression patterns within specific cell populations
Designed to facilitate discovery and data-driven insights, this application empowers researchers to interactively explore cellular heterogeneity and transcriptional dynamics in zebrafish and beyond.
